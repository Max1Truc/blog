So I recently found a Klipad, which was waiting somewhere in my house. It is a cheap, tiny tablet, and I wanted to tinker a bit with it. I then decided to somewhat root it, or even install GNU/ Linux on it. As it is running Android 8.1.0 and didn&amp;rsquo;t receive any security patches since something like September 2019, exploit-db.com gave me some ideas of root exploits. However, that would not be the simplest way to install GNU/ Linux, if it is even possible without breaking everything.</description></item></channel></rss>
