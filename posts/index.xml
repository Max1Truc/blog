        <description>Hey, so I am a beginner in cyber security, but I participated to the FCSC 2021.
I love Rust, and this CTF greeted me with a challenge in misc category around Rust, giving 500 points (the biggest score for a challenge :D).
So, let&amp;rsquo;s see how I pwned it!
This challenge is actually a website, which, given a program, tries to compile it in a directory related to your session cookie and never executes it.</description>

        <description>Hey! So I recently found a Klipad, which was waiting somewhere in my house. It is a cheap, tiny tablet, and I wanted to tinker a bit with it. I then decided to somewhat root it, or even install GNU/ Linux on it. As it is running Android 8.1.0 and didn&amp;rsquo;t receive any security patches since something like September 2019, exploit-db.com gave me some ideas of root exploits. However, that would not be the simplest way to install GNU/ Linux, if it is even possible without breaking everything.</description>
